# 💊 Web App Pharmacy

A simple CRUD-based ASP.NET Core MVC project for managing a pharmacy's operations. This is my first website built with .NET MVC. It includes functionalities for handling:

- 💵 Medicine pricing
- 👥 Customer transactions
- 👔 Employee roles

I’m planning to expand the system with an order feature that integrates with e-wallet APIs.
